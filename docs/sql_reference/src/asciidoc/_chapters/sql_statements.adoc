= SQL Statements

This section describes the syntax and semantics of Trafodion SQL statements.

Trafodion SQL statements are entered interactively or from script files using a client-based tool, such as the
Trafodion Command Interface (TrafCI). To install and configure a client application that enables you to connect
to and use a Trafodion database, see the
http://trafodion.incubator.apache.org/client_install/index.html[_Trafodion Client Installation_ _Guide_].

[[Data_Definition_Language_Statements]]
=== Data Definition Language (DDL) Statements

Use these DDL statements to create, drop, or alter the definition of a Trafodion SQL schema or object.

NOTE: DDL statements are not currently supported in transactions. That means that you cannot run DDL statements inside a user-defined
transaction (BEGIN WORK&#8230;COMMIT WORK) or when AUTOCOMMIT is OFF. To run these statements, AUTOCOMMIT must be turned ON
(the default) for the session.

[[ALTER_LIBRARY_Statement]]
== ALTER LIBRARY Statement

* <<alter_library_syntax,Syntax Description of ALTER LIBRARY>>
* <<alter_library_considerations,Considerations for ALTER LIBRARY>>
* <<alter_library_examples,Examples of ALTER LIBRARY>>

The ALTER LIBRARY statement updates the physical filename for a library object in a Trafodion database.
A library object can be an SPJ's JAR file or a UDF's library file.

ALTER LIBRARY is a Trafodion SQL extension.

NOTE: DDL statements are not currently supported in transactions. That means that you cannot run this statement inside 
user-defined transaction (`BEGIN WORK&#8230;COMMIT WORK`) or when AUTOCOMMIT is OFF. To run this statement, AUTOCOMMIT must be
turned ON (the default) for the session.

```
ALTER LIBRARY [[catalog-name.]schema-name.]library-name
   FILE library-filename
   [HOST NAME host-name]
   [LOCAL FILE host-filename]
```

<<<
[[alter_library_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of ALTER LIBRARY

* `[[_catalog-name_.]_schema-name_.]_library-name_`
+
specifies the ANSI logical name of the library object, where each part of the name is a valid SQL identifier with a maximum of 128 characters.
Specify the name of a library object that has already been registered in the schema. If you do not fully qualify the library name, Trafodion SQL
qualifies it according to the schema of the current session. For more information, see <<Identifiers,Identifiers>> and
<<_Database_Object_Names,Database Object Names>>.

* `FILE _library-filename_`
+
specifies the full path of the redeployed library file, which either an SPJ's JAR file or a UDF's library file.

* `HOST NAME _host-name_`
+
specifies the name of the client host machine where the deployed file resides.

* `LOCAL FILE _host-filename_`
+
specifies the path on the client host machine where the deployed file is stored.

[[alter_library_considerations]]
=== Considerations for ALTER LIBRARY

* HOST NAME and LOCAL FILE are position dependent.

==== Required Privileges

To issue an ALTER LIBRARY statement, one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are the owner of the library.
* You have the ALTER or ALTER_LIBRARY component privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS component.

<<<
[[alter_library_examples]]
=== Examples of ALTER LIBRARY

* This ALTER LIBRARY statement updates the JAR file (SPJs) for a library named SALESLIB in the SALES schema:
+
```
ALTER LIBRARY sales.saleslib FILE Sales2.jar;`

[[alter_table_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of ALTER TABLE

* `_name_`
+
specifies the current name of the object. See <<Database_Object_Names,Database Object Names>>.

* `ADD [COLUMN] _column-definition_`
+
adds a column to _table_.
+
The clauses for the _column-definition_ are:

** `_column-name_`
+
specifies the name for the new column in the table. _column-name_ is an SQL identifier. _column-name_ must be
unique among column names in the table. If the column name is a Trafodion SQL reserved word, you must
delimit it by enclosing it in double quotes. For example: `"sql".myview`. See <<Identifiers,Identifiers>>.

** `_data-type_`
+
specifies the data type of the values that can be stored in _column-name_. See <<Data_Types,Data Types>>
If a default is not specified, NULL is used.

** `DEFAULT _default_`
+
specifies a default value for the column or specifies that the column does not have a default value. You can declare the default value
explicitly by using the DEFAULT clause, or you can enable null to be used as the default by omitting both the DEFAULT and NOT NULL clauses.
If you omit the DEFAULT clause and specify NOT NULL, Trafodion SQL returns an error. For existing rows of the table, the added column takes
on its default value.
+
If you set the default to the datetime value CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, or CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, Trafodion SQL uses January 1, 1 A.D.
12:00:00.000000 as the default date and time for the existing rows.
+
For any row that you add after the column is added, if no value is specified for the column as part of the add row operation, the column
receives a default value based on the current timestamp at the time the row is added.

<<<
** `[[CONSTRAINT _constraint-name_] _column-constraint_]`
+
specifies a name for the column or table constraint. _constraint-name_ must have the same schema as _table_ and must be
unique among constraint names in its schema. If you omit the schema portions of the name you specify in _constraint-name_,
Trafodion SQL expands the constraint name by using the schema for _table_. See <<Database_Object_Names,Database Object Names>>.
+
If you do not specify a constraint name, Trafodion SQL constructs an SQL identifier as the name for the constraint in the schema
for _table._ The identifier consists of the fully qualified table name concatenated with a system-generated unique identifier.
For example, a constraint on table A.B.C might be assigned a name such as A.B.C_123&#8230;_01&#8230;.

*** `_column-constraint_` options:

**** `NOT NULL` 
+
is a column constraint that specifies that the column cannot contain nulls. If you omit NOT NULL, nulls are allowed in the column.
If you specify both NOT NULL and NO DEFAULT, then each row inserted in the table must include a value for the column. See <<Null,Null>>.

**** `UNIQUE`
+
is a column constraint that specifies that the column cannot contain more than one occurrence of the same value. If you omit UNIQUE,
duplicate values are allowed unless the column is part of the PRIMARY KEY. Columns that you define as unique must be specified as NOT NULL.

**** `CHECK (_condition_)`
+
is a constraint that specifies a condition that must be satisfied for each row in the table. See <<Search_Condition,Search Condition>>.
You cannot refer to the CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, or CURRENT_TIMESTAMP function in a CHECK constraint, and you cannot use
subqueries in a CHECK constraint.

<<<
**** `REFERENCES _ref-spec_`
+
specifies a REFERENCES column constraint. The maximum combined length of the columns for a REFERENCES constraint is 2048 bytes. +

***** `_ref-spec_` is:
+
`_referenced-table_ [(_column-list_)]`
+
`_referenced-table_` is the table referenced by the foreign key in a referential constraint. _referenced-table_ cannot be a view.
_referenced-table_ cannot be the same as _table_. _referenced-table_ corresponds to the foreign key in the _table_.
 +
`_column-list_` specifies the column or set of columns in the _referenced-table_ that corresponds to the foreign key in _table_. The
columns in the column list associated with REFERENCES must be in the same order as the columns in the column list associated with FOREIGN
KEY. If _column-list_ is omitted, the referenced table's PRIMARY KEY columns are the referenced columns.
+
A table can have an unlimited number of referential constraints, and you can specify the same foreign key in more than one referential
constraint, but you must define each referential constraint separately. You cannot create self-referencing foreign key constraints.

* `ADD [CONSTRAINT _constraint-name_] _table-constraint_`
+
adds a constraint to the table and optionally specifies _constraint-name_ as the name for the constraint. The new constraint
must be consistent with any data already present in the table. 

<<<
** `CONSTRAINT _constraint-name_`
+
specifies a name for the column or table constraint. _constraint-name_ must have the same schema as _table_ and must be unique among constraint
names in its schema. If you omit the schema portions of the name you specify in _constraint-name_, Trafodion SQL expands the constraint
name by using the schema for table. See <<Database_Object_Names,Database Object Names>>. 
+
If you do not specify a constraint name, Trafodion SQL constructs an SQL identifier as the name for the constraint in the schema for table. The
identifier consists of the fully qualified table name concatenated with a system-generated unique identifier. For example, a constraint on table
A.B.C might be assigned a name such as A.B.C_123&#8230;_01&#8230;.
+
** `_table-constraint_` options:

*** `UNIQUE (_column-list_)`
+
is a table constraint that specifies that the column or set of columns cannot contain more 
than one occurrence of the same value or set of values.
+
`_column-list_` cannot include more than one occurrence of the same column. In addition, the set of columns that you specify on a UNIQUE
constraint cannot match the set of columns on any other UNIQUE constraint for the table or on the PRIMARY KEY constraint for the table.
All columns defined as unique must be specified as NOT NULL.
+
A UNIQUE constraint is enforced with a unique index. If there is already a unique index on _column-list_, Trafodion SQL uses that index. If a
unique index does not exist, the system creates a unique index.

*** `CHECK (_condition_)`
+
is a constraint that specifies a condition that must be satisfied for each row in the table.
See <<Search_Condition,Search Condition>>. You cannot refer to the CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, or CURRENT_TIMESTAMP function in a CHECK
constraint, and you cannot use subqueries in a CHECK constraint.

<<<
*** `FOREIGN KEY (_column-list_) REFERENCES _ref-spec_ NOT ENFORCED`
+
is a table constraint that specifies a referential constraint for the table, declaring that a column or set of columns (called a foreign key)
in _table_ can contain only values that match those in a column or set of columns in the table specified in the REFERENCES
clause. However, because NOT ENFORCED is specified, this relationship is not checked.
+
The two columns or sets of columns must have the same characteristics (data type, length, scale, precision). Without the FOREIGN KEY clause,
the foreign key in _table_ is the column being defined; with the FOREIGN KEY clause, the foreign key is the column or set of columns specified in
the FOREIGN KEY clause. For information about _ref-spec_, see REFERENCES _ref-spec_ NOT ENFORCED.

* `DROP CONSTRAINT _constraint-name_ [RESTRICT]`
+
drops a constraint from the table. +
+
If you drop a constraint, Trafodion SQL drops its dependent index if Trafodion SQL originally created the same index. If the constraint uses
an existing index, the index is not dropped. +

** `CONSTRAINT _constraint-name_`
+
specifies a name for the column or table constraint. _constraint-name_ must have the same schema as _table_ and must be unique among constraint
names in its schema. If you omit the schema portions of the name you specify in _constraint-name_, Trafodion SQL expands the constraint
name by using the schema for table. See <<Database_Object_Names,Database Object Names>>.
+
If you do not specify a constraint name, Trafodion SQL constructs an SQL identifier as the name for the constraint in the schema for table. The
identifier consists of the fully qualified table name concatenated with a system-generated unique identifier. For example, a constraint on table
A.B.C might be assigned a name such as A.B.C_123&#8230;_01&#8230;.

* `RENAME TO _new-name_ [CASCADE]`
+
changes the logical name of the object within the same schema.

** `_new-name_`
+
specifies the new name of the object after the RENAME TO operation occurs.

<<<
** `CASCADE`
+
specifies that indexes and constraints on the renamed object will be renamed.

* `ADD IF NOT EXISTS _column-definition_`
+
adds a column to _table_ if it does not already exist in the table.
+
The clauses for the _column-definition_ are the same as described in ADD [COLUMN] _column-definition_.

* `DROP COLUMN [IF EXISTS] _column-name_`
+
drops the specified column from _table_, including the columnâ€™s data. You cannot drop a primary key column.

=== Considerations for ALTER TABLE

[[effect_of_adding_a_column_on_view_definitions]]
==== Effect of Adding a Column on View Definitions

The addition of a column to a table has no effect on existing view definitions. Implicit column references specified by SELECT * in view
definitions are replaced by explicit column references when the definition clauses are originally evaluated.

[[authorization_and_availability_requirements]]
==== Authorization and Availability Requirements

ALTER TABLE works only on user-created tables.

===== Required Privileges

To issue an ALTER TABLE statement, one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are the owner of the table.
* You have the ALTER or ALTER_TABLE component privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS component.

===== Privileges Needed to Create a Referential Integrity Constraint

To create a referential integrity constraint (that is, a constraint on the table that refers to a column in another table), one of the
following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are the owner of the referencing and referenced tables.
* You have these privileges on the referencing and referenced table:
** For the referencing table, you have the ALTER or ALTER_TABLE component privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS component.
** For the referenced table, you have the REFERENCES (or ALL) privilege on the referenced table through your username or through a granted role.

If the constraint refers to the other table in a query expression, you must also have SELECT privileges on the other table.

[[call_statement]]
== CALL Statement

* <<call_syntax,Syntax Description of CALL>>
* <<call_considerations,Considerations for CALL>>
* <<call_examples,Examples of CALL>>

The CALL statement invokes a stored procedure in Java (SPJ) in a Trafodion SQL database.

```
CALL procedure-ref ([argument-list])

procedure-ref is:
   [[catalog-name.]schema-name.]procedure-name

argument-list is:
   SQL-expression[, SQL-expression]...
```

[[call_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of CALL

* `_procedure-ref_`
+
specifies an ANSI logical name of the form:
+
`[[_catalog-name_.]_schema-name_.]_procedure-name_`
+
where each part of the name is a valid SQL identifier with a maximum of 128 characters. For more information, see
<<Identifiers,Identifiers>> and <<Database_Object_Names,Database Object Names>>.
+
If you do not fully qualify the procedure name, Trafodion SQL qualifies it according to the schema of the current session.

* `_argument-list_`
+
accepts arguments for IN, INOUT, or OUT parameters. The arguments consist of SQL expressions, including dynamic parameters,
separated by commas:
+
`_SQL-expression_[\{, _SQL-expression_}&#8230;]`
+
<<<
+
Each expression must evaluate to a value of one of these data types:
+
** Character value
** Date-time value
** Numeric value
+
Interval value expressions are disallowed in SPJs. For more information, see
<<call_input_parameter_arguments,Input Parameter Arguments>> and
<<call_output_parameter_arguments,Output Parameter Arguments>>.
+
Do not specify result sets in the argument list.

[[call_considerations]]
=== Considerations for CALL

[[call_usage_restrictions]]
==== Usage Restrictions

You can use a CALL statement as a stand-alone SQL statement in applications or command-line interfaces,
such as TrafCI. You cannot use a CALL statement inside a compound statement or with rowsets.

[[call_required_privileges]]
==== Required Privileges

To issue a CALL statement, one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are the owner of the stored procedure.
* You have the EXECUTE (or ALL) privileges, either directly through your username or through a granted role.
For more information, see the <<GRANT_Statement,GRANT Statement>>.

When the stored procedure executes, it executes as the Trafodion ID.

<<<
[[call_input_parameter_argument]]
==== Input Parameter Arguments

You pass data to an SPJ by using IN or INOUT parameters. For an IN
parameter argument, use one of these SQL expressions:

* Literal
* SQL function (including CASE and CAST expressions)
* Arithmetic or concatenation operation
* Scalar subquery
* Dynamic parameter (for example, ?) in an application
* Named (for example, ?param) or unnamed (for example, ?) parameter in TrafCI

For an INOUT parameter argument, you can use only a dynamic, named, or unnamed parameter. For more information, see
<<Expressions,Expressions>>.

[[call_output_parameter_arguments]]
==== Output Parameter Arguments

An SPJ returns values in OUT and INOUT parameters. Output parameter arguments must be dynamic parameters in an
application (for example, ?) or named or unnamed parameters in HPDCI (for example, ?param or ?). Each
calling application defines the semantics of the OUT and INOUT parameters in its environment.

[[call_data_conversion_parameter_arguments]]
==== Data Conversion of Parameter Arguments

Trafodion SQL performs an implicit data conversion when the data type of a parameter argument is compatible with
but does not match the formal data type of the stored procedure. For stored procedure input values,
the conversion is from the actual argument value to the formal parameter type. For stored procedure output values,
the conversion is from the actual output value, which has the data type of the formal parameter, to the declared
type of the dynamic parameter.

[[call_null_input_and_output]]
==== Null Input and Output

You can pass a null value as input to or output from an SPJ, provided that the corresponding Java data type of the
parameter supports nulls. If a null is input or output for a parameter that does not support nulls, Trafodion SQL
returns an error.

[[call_transaction_semantics]]
==== Transaction Semantics

The CALL statement automatically initiates a transaction if no active transaction exists. However, the failure of
a CALL statement does not always automatically abort the transaction.

[[call_examples]]
=== Examples of CALL

* In TrafCI, execute an SPJ named MONTHLYORDERS, which has one IN parameter represented by a literal and one OUT
parameter represented by an unnamed parameter, ?:
+
[source,sql]
----
CALL sales.monthlyorders(3,?);
----

<<<
* This CALL statement executes a stored procedure, which accepts one IN parameter (a date literal), returns one OUT
parameter (a row from the column, NUM_ORDERS), and returns two result sets:
+
[source,sql]
----
CALL sales.ordersummary('01/01/2001', ?);

The COMMIT WORK statement commits any changes to objects made during the current transaction and ends
the transaction. See <<Transaction_Management,Transaction Management>>.

WORK is an optional keyword that has no effect.

COMMIT WORK issued outside of an active transaction generates error 8605.

```
COMMIT [WORK]

[[commit_work_considerations]]
=== Considerations for COMMIT WORK

BEGIN WORK starts a transaction. COMMIT WORK or ROLLBACK WORK ends a transaction.

<<<
[[commit_work_examples]]
=== Example of COMMIT WORK

Suppose that your application adds information to the inventory. You have received 24 terminals from
a new supplier and want to add the supplier and update the quantity on hand. The part number for the
terminals is 5100, and the supplier is assigned supplier number 17. The cost of each terminal is $800.

The transaction must add the order for terminals to PARTSUPP, add the supplier to the SUPPLIER table,
and update QTY_ON_HAND in PARTLOC. After the INSERT and UPDATE statements execute successfully,
you commit the transaction, as shown:

[source,sql]
----
-- This statement initiates a transaction.

[[control_query_cancel_statement]]
== CONTROL QUERY CANCEL Statement

The CONTROL QUERY CANCEL statement cancels an executing query that you identify with a query ID.
You can execute the CONTROL QUERY CANCEL statement in a client-based tool like TrafCI or through any ODBC or JDBC
application.

CONTROL QUERY CANCEL is a Trafodion SQL extension.

```
CONTROL QUERY CANCEL QID query-id [COMMENT 'comment-text']
```

[[control_query_cancel_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of CONTROL QUERY CANCEL

* `_query-id_`
+
specifies the query ID of an executing query, which is a unique identifier generated by the SQL compiler.

* `'_comment-text_'`
+
specifies an optional comment to be displayed in the canceled queryâ€™s error message.

[[control_query_cancel_considerations]]
=== Considerations for CONTROL QUERY CANCEL

[[control_query_cancel_benefitsl]]
==== Benefits of CONTROL QUERY CANCEL

For many queries, the CONTROL QUERY CANCEL statement allows the termination of the query without stopping the
master executor process (MXOSRVR). This type of cancellation has these benefits over standard ODBC/JDBC cancel
methods:

* An ANSI-defined error message is returned to the client session, and SQLSTATE is set to HY008.
* Important cached objects persist after the query is canceled, including the master executor process and its
compiler, the compiled statements cached in the master, and the compilerâ€™s query cache and its cached metadata
and histograms.
* The client does not need to reestablish its connection, and its prepared statements are preserved.
* When clients share connections using a middle-tier application server, the effects of canceling one clientâ€™s
executing query no longer affect other clients sharing the same connection.

[[control_query_cancel_restrictions]]
==== Restrictions on CONTROL QUERY CANCEL

Some executing queries may not respond to a CONTROL QUERY CANCEL statement within a 60-second interval. For those
queries, Trafodion SQL stops their ESP processes if there are any. If this action allows the query to be canceled,
you will see all the benefits listed above.

If the executing query does not terminate within 120 seconds after the CONTROL QUERY CANCEL statement is issued,
Trafodion SQL stops the master executor process, terminating the query and generating a lost connection error.
In this case, you will not see any of the benefits listed above. Instead, you will lose your connection and will
need to reconnect and re-prepare the query. This situation often occurs with the CALL, DDL, and utility statements
and rarely with other statements.

The CONTROL QUERY CANCEL statement does not work with these statements:

* Unique queries, which operate on a single row and a single partition
* Queries that are not executing, such as a query that is being compiled
* CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT, BEGIN WORK, COMMIT WORK, ROLLBACK WORK, and EXPLAIN statements
* Statically compiled metadata queries
* Queries executed in anomalous conditions, such as queries without runtime statistics or without a query ID

[[control_query_cancel_required_privileges]]
==== Required Privileges

To issue a CONTROL QUERY CANCEL statement, one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You own (that is, issued) the query.
* You have the QUERY_CANCEL component privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS component.

<<<
[[control_query_cancel_examples]]

[[control_query_default_statement]]
== CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT Statement

The CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT statement changes the default settings for the current process. You can execute
the CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT statement in a client-based tool like TrafCI or through any ODBC or JDBC application.

CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT is a Trafodion SQL extension.

```
{ CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT | CQD } control-default-option

control-default-option is:
  attribute {'attr-value' | RESET}
```

[[control_query_default_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT

* `_attribute_`
+
is a character string that represents an attribute name. For descriptions of these attributes,
see <<Control_Query_Default_Attributes,Control Query Default (CQD) Attributes>>.

* `_attr-value_`
+
is a character string that specifies an attribute value. You must specify _attr-value_ as a quoted stringâ€”even
if the value is a number.

* `RESET`

specifies that the attribute that you set by using a CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT statement in the current session is
to be reset to the value or values in effect at the start of the current session.

<<<
[[control_query_default_considerations]]
=== Considerations for CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT

[[control_query_default_scope]]
==== Scope of CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT

The result of the execution of a CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT statement stays in effect until the current process
terminates or until the execution of another statement for the same attribute overrides it.

CQDs are applied at compile time, so CQDs do not affect any statements that are already prepared. For example:

[source,sql]
----
PREPARE x FROM SELECT * FROM t;
CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT SCHEMA 'myschema';
EXECUTE x;                              -- uses the default schema SEABASE

== CREATE INDEX Statement

* <<create_index_syntax,Syntax Description of CREATE INDEX>>
* <<create_index_considerations,Considerations for CREATE INDEX>>
* <<create_index_examples ,Examples of CREATE INDEX>>

The CREATE INDEX statement creates an SQL index based on one or more columns of a table or table-like object.
The CREATE VOLATILE INDEX statement creates an SQL index with a lifespan that is limited to the SQL session that
the index is created. Volatile indexes are dropped automatically when the session ends. See <<Indexes,Indexes>>.

CREATE INDEX is a Trafodion SQL extension.

NOTE: DDL statements are not currently supported in transactions. That means that you cannot run this statement
inside a user-defined transaction (BEGIN WORK&#8230;COMMIT WORK) or when AUTOCOMMIT is OFF. To run this statement,
AUTOCOMMIT must be turned ON (the default) for the session.

```
CREATE [VOLATILE] INDEX index ON table
   (column-name [ASC[ENDING] | DESC[ENDING]]
   [,column-name [ASC[ENDING] | DESC[ENDING]]]...)
   [HBASE_OPTIONS (hbase-options-list)]

hbase-options-list is:
   hbase-option = 'value'[, hbase-option = 'value']...
```

[[create_index_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of CREATE INDEX

* `_index_`
+
is an SQL identifier that specifies the simple name for the new index. You cannot qualify _index_ with its schema
name. Indexes have their own namespace within a schema, so an index name might be the same as a table or constraint
name. However, no two indexes in a schema can have the same name.

* `_table_`
+
is the name of the table for which to create the index. See <<Database_Object_Names,Database Object Names>>.

* `_column-name_ [ASC[ENDING] | DESC[ENDING]] [,_column-name_ [ASC[ENDING] | DESC[ENDING]]]&#8230;`
+
specifies the columns in _table_ to include in the index. The order of the columns in the index need not correspond
to the order of the columns in the table.
+
ASCENDING or DESCENDING specifies the storage and retrieval order for rows in the index. The default is ASCENDING.
+
Rows are ordered by values in the first column specified for the index. If multiple index rows share the same value
for the first column, the values in the second column are used to order the rows, and so forth. If duplicate index
rows occur in a nonunique index, their order is based on the sequence specified for the columns of the key of the
underlying table. For ordering (but not for other purposes), nulls are greater than other values.

* `HBASE_OPTIONS (_hbase-option_ = '_value_'[, _hbase-option_ = '_value_']&#8230;)`
+
a list of HBase options to set for the index. These options are applied independently of any HBase options set for
the indexâ€™s table.

// TODO: The Word document did not list all default values. 
** `_hbase-option_ = '_value_'`
+
is one of the these HBase options and its assigned value:

[[create_index_considerations]]
=== Considerations for CREATE INDEX

Indexes are created under a single transaction. When an index is created, the following steps occur:

* Transaction begins (either a user-started transaction or a system-started transaction).
* Rows are written to the metadata.
* Physical labels are created to hold the index (as non audited).
* The base table is locked for read shared access which prevents inserts, updates, and deletes on the base table from occurring.
* The index is loaded by reading the base table for read uncommitted access using side tree inserts.
+
NOTE: A side tree insert is a fast way of loading data that can perform specialized optimizations because the
partitions are not audited and empty.

* After load is complete, the index audit attribute is turned on and it is attached to the base table (to bring the index online).
* The transaction is committed, either by the system or later by the requestor.

If the operation fails after basic semantic checks are performed, the index no longer exists and the entire transaction
is rolled back even if it is a user-started transaction.

[[create_index_authorization_and_availability_requirements]]
==== Authorization and Availability Requirements

An index always has the same security as the table it indexes.

CREATE INDEX locks out INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE operations on the table being indexed. If other processes have rows in the table locked
when the operation begins, CREATE INDEX waits until its lock request is granted or timeout occurs.

You cannot access an index directly.

<<<
[[create_index_required_priviges]]
==== Required Privileges

To issue a CREATE INDEX statement, one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are creating the table in a shared schema.
* You are the private schema owner.
* You are the owner of the table.
* You have the ALTER, ALTER_TABLE, CREATE, or CREATE_INDEX component privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS component.
+
NOTE: In this case, if you create an index in a private schema, it will be owned by the schema owner.

[[create_index_limits]]
==== Limits on Indexes

For nonunique indexes, the sum of the lengths of the columns in the index plus the sum of the length of
the clustering key of the underlying table cannot exceed 2048 bytes.

No restriction exists on the number of indexes per table.

The CREATE LIBRARY statement registers a library object in a Trafodion database. A library object
can be an SPJ's JAR file or a UDF's library file.

CREATE LIBRARY is a Trafodion SQL extension.

NOTE: DDL statements are not currently supported in transactions. That means that you cannot run
this statement inside a user-defined transaction (BEGIN WORK&#8230;COMMIT WORK) or when AUTOCOMMIT

[[create_library_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of CREATE LIBRARY

* `[[_catalog-name_.]_schema-name_.]_library-name_`
+
specifies the ANSI logical name of the library object, where each part of the name is a valid SQL
identifier with a maximum of 128 characters. Specify a name that is unique and does not exist for
libraries in the same schema. If you do not fully qualify the library name, Trafodion SQ qualifies
it according to the schema of the current session. For more information, see <<Identifiers,Identifiers>>
and <<Database_Object_Names,Database Object Names>>.

<<<
* `FILE '_library-filename_'`
+
specifies the full path of a deployed library file, which either an SPJ's JAR file or a UDF's library file.
+
NOTE: Make sure to upload the library file to the Trafodion cluster and then copy the library file to the
same directory on all the nodes in the cluster before running the CREATE LIBRARY statement. Otherwise, you
will see an error message indicating that the JAR or DLL file was not found.

* `HOST NAME '_host-name_'`
+
specifies the name of the client host machine where the deployed file resides.

* `LOCAL FILE '_host-filename_'`
+
specifies the path on the client host machine where the deployed file is stored.

[[create_library_considerations]]
=== Considerations for CREATE LIBRARY

* A library object cannot refer to a library file referenced by another library object. If the _library-filename_
is in use by another library object, the CREATE LIBRARY command will fail.
* The _library-filename_ must specify an existing file. Otherwise, the CREATE LIBRARY command will fail.
* The CREATE LIBRARY command does not verify that the specified _library-filename_ is a valid executable file.
* HOST NAME and LOCAL FILE are position dependent.

* `_procedure-ref_([_sql-parameter_[, _sql-parameter_]&#8230;])`
+
specifies the name of the stored procedure in Java (SPJ) and any SQL parameters that correspond to the signature of
the SPJ methaod.

** `_procedure-ref_`
+
specifies an ANSI logical name of the form:
+
`[[_catalog-name_.]_schema-name_.]_procedure-name_`
+
where each part of the name is a valid SQL identifier with a maximum of 128 characters. For more information,
see <<Identifiers,Identifiers>> and <<Database_Object_Names,Database Object Names>>.
+
Specify a name that is unique and does not exist for any procedure or function in the same schema. Trafodion SQL
does not support the overloading of procedure names. That is, you cannot register the same procedure name more than
once with different underlying SPJ methods.
+
If you do not fully qualify the procedure name, Trafodion SQL qualifies it according to the schema of the current session.

** _sql-parameter_
+
specifies an SQL parameter that corresponds to the signature of the SPJ method:
+
`[_parameter-mode_] [_sql-identifier_] _sql-datatype_`

*** `_parameter-mode_`
+
specifies the mode IN, OUT, or INOUT of a parameter. The default is IN.

**** `IN`
+
specifies a parameter that passes data to an SPJ.

1. The Trafodion database stores PIC X as a CHAR data type.
2. Numeric data types of SQL parameters must be SIGNED, which is the default in the Trafodion database.
3. The Trafodion database stores PIC S9 as a DECIMAL or NUMERIC data type.
4. By default, the SQL data type maps to a Java primitive type. The SQL data type maps to a Java wrapper class
only if you specify the wrapper class in the Java signature of the EXTERNAL NAME clause.
+
For more information, see <<Data_Types,Data Types>>.

* `EXTERNAL NAME '_java-method-name_ [_java-signature_]'`

** `_java-method-name_`
+
specifies the case-sensitive name of the SPJ method of the form:
+
`[_package-name_.]_class-name_._method-name_`
+
The Java method must exist in a Java class file, _class-name_.class, within a library registered in the database.
The Java method must be defined as public and static and have a return type of void.
+
If the class file that contains the SPJ method is part of a package, you must also specify the package name.
If you do not specify the package name, the CREATE PROCEDURE statement fails to register the SPJ.

** `_java-signature_`
+
specifies the signature of the SPJ method and consists of:
+
`([_java-datatype_[, _java-datatype_]&#8230;])`
+
The Java signature is necessary only if you want to specify a Java wrapper class (for example, java.lang.Integer) instead of a Java
primitive data type (for example, int). An SQL data type maps to a Java primitive data type by default.
+
The Java signature is case-sensitive and must be placed within parentheses, such as (java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Integer).
The signature must specify each of the parameter data types in the order they appear in the Java method definition within
the class file. Each Java data type that corresponds to an OUT or INOUT parameter must befollowed by empty square
brackets ([ ]), such as java.lang.Integer[].

<<<
*** `_java-datatype_`
+
specifies a mappable Java data type. For the mapping of the Java data types to SQL data types, see _sql-datatype_.

* `LIBRARY [[_catalog-name_.]_schema-name_.]_library-name_`
+
specifies the ANSI logical name of a library containing the SPJ method. If you do not fully qualify the library name,
Trafodion SQL qualifies it according to the schema of the current session.

* `EXTERNAL SECURITY _external-security-type_`
+
determines the privileges, or rights, that users have when executing (or calling) the SPJ. An SPJ can have one of these
types of external security:

** INVOKER determines that users can execute, or invoke, the stored procedure using the privileges of the user who invokes
the stored procedure. This behavior is referred to as _invoker rights_ and is the default behavior if EXTERNAL SECURITY is
not specified. Invoker rights allow a user who has the execute privilege on the SPJ to call the SPJ using his or her existing
privileges. In this case, the user must be granted privileges to access the underlying database objects on which the SPJ operates.
+
NOTE: Granting a user privileges to the underlying database objects gives the user direct access to those database objects,
which could pose a risk to more sensitive or critical data to which users should not have access. For example, an SPJ
might operate on a subset of the data in an underlying database object, but that database object might contain other
more sensitive or critical data to which users should not have access.

** DEFINER determines that users can execute, or invoke, the stored procedure using the privileges of the user who created
the stored procedure. This behavior is referred to as _definer rights_. The advantage of definer rights is that users are
allowed to manipulate data by invoking the stored procedure without having to be granted privileges to the underlying
database objects. That way, users are restricted from directly accessing or manipulating more sensitive or critical data in
the database. However, be careful about the users to whom you grant execute privilege on an SPJ with definer external security
because those users will be able to execute the SPJ without requiring privileges to the underlying database objects.

<<<
* `LANGUAGE JAVA`
+
specifies that the external user-defined routine is written in the Java language.

* `PARAMETER STYLE JAVA`
+
specifies that the run-time conventions for arguments passed to the external user-defined routine are those of the Java language.

* `NO SQL`
+
specifies that the SPJ cannot perform SQL operations.

* `CONTAINS SQL | MODIFIES SQL DATA | READS SQL DATA`
+
specifies that the SPJ can perform SQL operations. All these options behave the same as CONTAINS SQL, meaning that the SPJ
can read and modify SQL data. Use one of these options to register a method that contains SQL statements. If you do not specify
an SQL access mode, the default is CONTAINS SQL.

* `DYNAMIC RESULT SETS _integer_`
+
specifies the maximum number of result sets that the SPJ can return. This option is applicable only if the method signature
contains a java.sql.ResultSet[] object. If the method contains a result set object, the valid range is 1 to 255 inclusive.
The actual number of result sets returned by the SPJ method can be less than or equal to this number. If you do not specify
this option, the default value is 0 (zero), meaning that the SPJ does not return result sets.

* `TRANSACTION REQUIRED | NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED`
+
determines whether the SPJ must run in a transaction inherited from the calling application (TRANSACTION REQUIRED, the default
option) or whether the SPJ runs without inheriting the calling applicationâ€™s transaction (NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED). Typically,
you will want the stored procedure to inherit the transaction from the calling application. However, if the SPJ method does
not access the database or if you want the stored procedure to manage its own transactions, you should set the stored
procedureâ€™s transaction attribute to NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED. For more information, see
<<Effects_of_the_Transaction_Attribute_on_SPJs,Effects of the Transaction Attribute on SPJs>>.

<<<
* `DETERMINISTIC | NOT DETERMINISTIC`
+
specifies whether the SPJ always returns the same values for OUT and INOUT parameters for a given set of argument values
(DETERMINISTIC) or does not return the same values (NOT DETERMINISTIC, the default option). If you specify DETERMINISTIC,
Trafodion SQL is not required to call the SPJ each time to produce results; instead, Trafodion SQL caches the results and
reuses them during subsequent calls, thus optimizing the CALL statement.

* `NO ISOLATE | ISOLATE`
+
specifies that the SPJ executes either in the environment of the database server (NO ISOLATE) or in an isolated environment
(ISOLATE, the default option). Trafodion SQL allows both options but always executes the SPJ in the UDR server process (ISOLATE).

=== Considerations for CREATE PROCEDURE

[[create_procedure_required_privileges]]
==== Required Privileges

To issue a CREATE PROCEDURE statement, one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are creating the procedure in a shared schema, and you have the USAGE (or ALL) privilege on the library that will be
used in the creation of the stored procedure. The USAGE privilege provides you with read access to the libraryâ€™s underlying
JAR file, which contains the SPJ Java method.
* You are the private schema owner and have the USAGE (or ALL) privilege on the library that will be used in the creation of
the stored procedure. The USAGE privilege provides you with read access to the libraryâ€™s underlying JAR file, which contains
the SPJ Java method.
* You have the CREATE or CREATE_ROUTINE component level privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS component and have the USAGE (or ALL)
privilege on the library that will be used in the creation of the stored procedure. The USAGE privilege provides you with read
access to the libraryâ€™s underlying JAR file, which contains the SPJ Java method.
+
NOTE: In this case, if you create a stored procedure in a private schema, it will be owned by the schema owner.

<<<
[[effects_of_the_transaction_attribute_on_spjs]]
==== Effects of the Transaction Attribute on SPJs

===== Transaction Required

_Using Transaction Control Statements or Methods_

If you specify TRANSACTION REQUIRED (the default option), a CALL statement automatically initiates a transaction if there is
no active transaction. In this case, you should not use transaction control statements (or equivalent JDBC transaction methods)
in the SPJ method. Transaction control statements include COMMIT WORK and ROLLBACK WORK, and the equivalent JDBC transaction
methods are Connection.commit() and Connection.rollback(). If you try to use transaction control statements or methods in an
SPJ method when the stored procedureâ€™s transaction attribute is set to TRANSACTION REQUIRED, the transaction control statements
or methods in the SPJ method are ignored, and the Java virtual machine (JVM) does not report any errors or warnings. When the
stored procedureâ€™s transaction attribute is set to TRANSACTION REQUIRED, you should rely on the transaction control statements
or methods in the application that calls the stored procedure and allow the calling application to manage the transactions.

_Committing or Rolling Back a Transaction_

If you do not use transaction control statements in the calling application, the transaction initiated by the CALL statement
might not automatically commit or roll back changes to the database. When AUTOCOMMIT is ON (the default setting), the database
engine automatically commits or rolls back any changes made to the database at the end of the CALL statement execution. However,
when AUTOCOMMIT is OFF, the current transaction remains active until the end of the client session or until you explicitly commit
or roll back the transaction. To ensure an atomic unit of work when calling an SPJ, use the COMMIT WORK statement in the calling
application to commit the transaction when the CALL statement succeeds, and use the ROLLBACK WORK statement to roll back the
transaction when the CALL statement fails.

<<<
===== No Transaction Required

In some cases, you might not want the SPJ method to inherit the transaction from the calling application. Instead, you might want
the stored procedure to manage its own transactions or to run without a transaction. Not inheriting the calling applicationâ€™s
transaction is useful in these cases:

* The stored procedure performs several long-running operations, such as multiple DDL or table maintenance operations, on the
database. In this case, you might want to commit those operations periodically from within the SPJ method to avoid locking tables
for a long time.
* The stored procedure performs certain SQL operations that must run without an active transaction. For example, INSERT, UPDATE,
and DELETE statements with the WITH NO ROLLBACK option are rejected when a transaction is already active, as is the case when a
stored procedure inherits a transaction from the calling application. The PURGEDATA utility is also rejected when a transaction
is already active.
* The stored procedure does not access the database. In this case, the stored procedure does not need to inherit the transaction
from the calling application. By setting the stored procedureâ€™s transaction attribute to NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED, you can avoid
the overhead of the calling applicationâ€™s transaction being propagated to the stored procedure.

In these cases, you should set the stored procedureâ€™s transaction attribute to NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED when creating the stored
procedure.

If you specify NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED and if the SPJ method creates a JDBC default connection, that connection will have autocommit
enabled by default. You can either use the autocommit transactions or disable autocommit (conn.setAutoCommit(false);) and use the
JDBC transaction methods, Connection.commit() and Connection.rollback(), to commit or roll back work where needed.

Since the procedure does not read and modify any SQL data, NO SQL is specified in the CREATE PROCEDURE statement.

* This CREATE PROCEDURE statement registers an SPJ named MONTHLYORDERS, which accepts an integer value for the month
and returns the number of orders:
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE PROCEDURE sales.monthlyorders(IN INT, OUT number INT)
   EXTERNAL NAME 'Sales.numMonthlyOrders (int, java.lang.Integer[])'
   LIBRARY sales.saleslib
   LANGUAGE JAVA
   PARAMETER STYLE JAVA
   READS SQL DATA;
----
+
Because the OUT parameter is supposed to map to the Java wrapper class, java.lang.Integer, you must specify the Java
signature in the EXTERNAL NAME clause. To invoke this SPJ, use this CALL statement:
+
[source,sql]
----
CALL sales.monthlyorders(3, ?);

ORDERNUM

          4
