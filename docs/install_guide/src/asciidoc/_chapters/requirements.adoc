= Requirements

The current release of Trafodion has been tested with:

* 64-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.5, 6.6, and 6.7
* SUSE SLES 11.3
* Cloudera CDH 5.2
* Cloudera CDH 5.3
* Hortonworks HDP 2.2

Other OS releases may work, too. The Trafodion project is currently working on better support for non-distribution version of Hadoop.

== General Hardware and OS Requirements and Recommendations

Trafodion assumes an environment based on the requirements of the supported Hadoop distributions. Please verify these assumptions on 
each server you will install Trafodion on:

* `bash` is available for shell-script execution.
* `sshd` (the `ssh` daemon) is running on each node in the cluster.
* `ntpd` (the `ntp` daemon) is running and synchronizign time on each node in the cluster.
* `/etc/hosts` is set up for fully-qualified node names (FQDN).
* `/etc/resolv.conf` is configured to use a name server tat can resolve commands such as `host -T <FQDN>`. 
Please attempt to use such a command to validate host-name resolution.
* The Linux Kernel Firewall (`iptables`) has either been disabled (to check: `service iptables status` (requires sudo access) 
or [ports required by Trafodion] have been opened
