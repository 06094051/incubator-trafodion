BASICS - On ERROR: if stream has no MD-ref - then stream is deleted.

WRITEREAD(md) -> stream has a MD-ref. so if there's an error -> no problem.
Once WRITEREAD completes, MD-ref is taken away and if there's an error
- stream is deleted.

For MS, on OPEN, OD created.
For FS, on OPEN, FD created.

OD is deleted on close (if free-oid).

On OD close, OD->ip_stream is closed and cleared

FD is deleted on close (if MD-ref-count is 0).
